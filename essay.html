                                The internet is a extremely useful tool and resource for information to those of
                                all ages.
                                However, it is so widespread and difficult to monitor that parents are having a hard
                                time
                                protecting one of the most easily influenced age groups, young children. Not only does
                                the
                                internet act as a tool for finding useful information, but it can also be used as a
                                tool
                                for communication between a wide range of online users. This enables users to
                                communicate
                                anonymously making it very difficult for you to really know who you are talking to. It
                                is
                                extremely difficult for parents to monitor their child’s activities on the internet. In
                                order to help parents better protect their children from malicious internet users COPPA
                                was
                                created.

                                COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, requires that the Federal Trade
                                Commission regulate the usage and collection of the personal information of minors
                                under
                                thirteen. Enacted in 1998 by legislators in hopes of “protecting children from
                                predatory
                                marketing, physical safety risks such as stalking or kidnapping, and other abuses that
                                may
                                result from others’ access to children’s private data.” As parents and legislators were
                                fearful of the how dangerous the internet could be as it grew and it’s new wide scale
                                availability, COPPA was enacted to “provide parents with better tools to protect their
                                children in an online era” (Bryan, 1998).

                                In 1998 there were almost 10 million active users on the internet below the age of 13
                                in
                                the United States alone. This is a large amount of minors at risk from unregulated data
                                collection. In a time where the internet was largely unknown and security was minimal
                                and/or completely lacking, the Child Online Privacy Protection Act was in put place. It
                                was
                                designed to help parents corral and control what personal information could be captured
                                and
                                collected by others about their children’s internet use. Information that is collected
                                on
                                websites such as telephone numbers, addresses, names, social security numbers, and
                                photographs are all covered by COPPA’s rules and regulations which classified these
                                details
                                as personal information.

                                With the internet, people all over the world can anonymously talk to the most
                                susceptible
                                group, children. Monitoring minors is extremely difficult on the internet, especially
                                when
                                it was new and mostly uncharted. Chatrooms and forums popping up online regularly
                                allowed
                                anonymous communication. COPPA makes websites require parent’s permission to allow a
                                minor
                                under thirteen to make an account, but it is difficult to confirm that the “parent”
                                actually gave consent. To combat this, many websites simply ban users under thirteen
                                years
                                of age from their terms of service to bypass these regulations and requirements. Many
                                minors can easily get around this law that is trying to protect them by lying about
                                their
                                age online. They simply enter an older, false date of birth, allowing websites to
                                collect
                                information on them under the guise that they are “adult” members bypassing COPPA’s
                                laws.
                                One effort to help this COPPA does is requiring websites targeting youth to have a
                                mechanism to require parent permission, often through use of a credit card.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite COPPA’s purpose to protect children and be a positive factor online, it tends
                                to
                                create frustrations for online companies tailored towards kids. Due to COPPA
                                guidelines,
                                they continually must jump through hoops to have their website approved, and many of
                                these
                                hoops can create frustration for parents and kids as well. These may include things
                                like
                                requiring credit card information, calling toll-free numbers, and accepting digital
                                signatures to verify age and identity. These official procedures, although there to
                                protect, can be frustrating and annoying. Does this actually protect though? Kids can
                                easily work around these issues to get where they want to go. The best solution to this
                                issue is parental controls. There are also now tablets and computers designed for kids,
                                giving the parent control of all content they are able to see, and access they are
                                given
                                for downloading, buying, etc.
